# About this project

Welcome! You are a brand new developer starting out at Acme Software Incorporated! You have just completed your first week, including some excellent onboarding sessions to learn about the history of the company, the current technology architecture, and the future roadmap for the platform. You have had some great team lunches and tasty welcome donuts. You have a basic understanding of Acme’s business, which is to work with smaller, independent restaurants to engage with their customers and potential customers to come in for specials, happy hours and events. Acme does this through various channels including automated phone calls, texts, email and others. Acme prides itself on the ability to determine both the best message to use to engage food lovers and when to most effectively engage them.

Now you are ready to get down to business! In talking with your Scrum team and your technical lead, you have determined that the first task you are going to take on is to implement a new feature that determines when to best contact individuals based on the weather. Acme’s product team has determined the following:

·  The best time to engage a customer via a text message is when it is sunny and warmer than 75 degrees Fahrenheit

·  The best time to engage a customer via email is when it is between 55 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit

·  The best time to engage a customer via a phone call is when it is less than 55 degrees or when it is raining

You will need to build a function that uses the API provided by openweathermap.org at the following url:

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=minneapolis,us&units=imperial&APPID=09110e603c1d5c272f94f64305c09436

The documentation for this API can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

Your function should determine what outreach method is best for Minneapolis, MN over the next 5 days. The forecast will give you data for multiple points during a given day, you may choose to use that data how you wish. In general Acme uses technologies from the C# family to implement services and has a preference for single page JavaScript applications for the frontend using Angular or React. However, you may use whatever language you would prefer. The function can be run as either a web application or a command line application. If it is a web application it should display a 5 day calendar with the best outreach method listed for that date, if it is a command line application it should print out each date and the best outreach method for that day on a new line.

This will be your first work in your new role, so please put your best foot forward and build this to your professional best. You may use any online resources or open source libraries to implement the solution, but all the code developed must be your own. Once you have completed all of the work, please create a GitHub repository with your project and email a link to it to Nate (nlee@qconsulting.com).

# Output

The output is a standard CSV file in the format preferred-contact-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv.  The columns are: timestamp, temperature, condition, and preferred contact method.
